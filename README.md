# monty-hall
## monty_hall.py
This program proves the effectiveness of the switch strategy for the Monty Hall Problem.

## monty_hall_test.py
This test suite tests several functions from monty_hall.py. Two functions that use random.shuffle are not tested, because mocking random.shuffle is difficult. Functions that use random.randint are successfully mocked.
